# Refinance Feature Design Document

## 1. Overview and Requirements

### Purpose
Implement a comprehensive refinance analysis feature that calculates the net benefit of refinancing a mortgage over time, accounting for closing costs, investment opportunities, tax implications, and optional lump sum paydowns.

### Core Functionality (Based on Legacy Python Analysis)
- **Benefit Curve Analysis**: Calculate month-by-month net benefit of refinancing vs. keeping existing loan
- **Breakeven Analysis**: Identify the time point where refinancing becomes profitable
- **Investment Integration**: Account for investing monthly payment savings at specified after-tax returns
- **Tax Considerations**: Include mortgage interest deduction limits and tax savings differential
- **Lump Sum Paydown**: Optional additional principal payment at refinance time
- **Interactive Visualization**: Plot benefit curve with breakeven highlighting and hover details
- **Summary Tables**: Present key metrics and scenarios in tabular format

### Key Parameters
- **Loan Details**: Current principal, old rate, new rate, original term, remaining months
- **Financial**: Closing costs, tax rate, mortgage interest deduction limit
- **Investment**: Annual investment return rate for payment savings
- **Optional**: Lump sum paydown amount

## 2. Function Architecture

### New Functions (fct_refinance.R)

#### Core Calculation Functions

```r
#' Calculate Refinance Benefit Over Time
#'
#' Computes the cumulative net benefit of refinancing vs. keeping existing loan
#' for each month of a specified holding period. Handles both beneficial refinances
#' (rate reductions) and detrimental refinances (rate increases).
#'
#' Includes consideration of tax savings if tax_rate > 0. The tax savings come from
#' the mortgage interest deduction limit (MID), and assumes your deductions are itemized
#' and that the relevant tax bracket for the deductions is fixed.
#'
#' Also includes consideration of investment returns on the monthly savings from the
#' refinance if investment_return_annual > 0. This assumes the returns are reinvested
#' and compounded monthly.
#'
#' The two primary bottom-line metrics are:
#' - `net_cash_benefits`: The cumulative cash benefit of refinancing vs. keeping the existing loan
#' - `net_benefits`: The cumulative net benefit of refinancing vs. keeping the existing loan
#'   (includes changes in equity). This is useful if you plan to sell the home before the
#'   end of the holding period (because equity would convert to cash).

                                 show_breakeven = TRUE)
```

## 3. Mathematical Implementation

### Core Algorithm: Incremental Month-by-Month Calculation

The implementation uses an incremental approach that accurately models the cash flows and investment growth over time, rather than analytical formulas. This provides more precise results for complex scenarios.

### Monthly Benefit Calculation Framework
For each evaluation month k, two key metrics are calculated:

```
Net_Cash_Benefit_k = Cumulative_Investment_k - Closing_Costs + Tax_Savings_Diff_k
Net_Wealth_Benefit_k = Net_Cash_Benefit_k + Equity_Diff_k
```

Where:
- **Net_Cash_Benefit_k**: Cash-only benefit (what you'd have if not selling home)
- **Net_Wealth_Benefit_k**: Total wealth impact (includes equity changes, relevant if selling)
- **Equity_Diff_k**: Additional equity from lump sum paydown and different amortization schedules

### Investment Return Calculation (Incremental Compounding)
```r
# Initialize cumulative investment value
cumulative_investment <- 0

# For each month k:
for (k in months) {
  # Calculate current month's cash flow difference
  current_old_payment <- if (k <= n_payments_remaining) old_payment else 0
  current_new_payment <- if (k <= n_payments_new) new_payment else 0
  current_monthly_savings <- current_old_payment - current_new_payment

  # Compound previous investment and add current month's savings
  cumulative_investment <- cumulative_investment * (1 + investment_rate_per_month) + current_monthly_savings
}
```

This approach properly handles:
- **Variable loan terms**: When new loan term â‰  old loan remaining term
- **Zero investment returns**: Direct summation without division by zero
- **Month-by-month compounding**: More accurate than analytical annuity formulas for complex scenarios

### Tax Savings Calculation (Incremental MID Tracking)
```r
# Initialize cumulative deductible interest for both loans
cumulative_deductible_interest_old <- 0
cumulative_deductible_interest_new <- 0

# For each month k:
for (k in months) {
  # Calculate current balances
  old_balance <- compute_principal_remaining(old_payment, rate_old, max(0, n_payments_remaining - k))
  new_balance <- compute_principal_remaining(new_payment, rate_new, max(0, n_payments_new - k))

  # Add monthly deductible interest if balance > $0.005 (avoid tiny amounts)
  if (old_balance > 0.005) {
    monthly_interest_old <- old_balance * rate_per_month_old
    deductible_factor_old <- if (old_balance <= mid_limit) 1.0 else (mid_limit / old_balance)
    cumulative_deductible_interest_old <- cumulative_deductible_interest_old +
                                         (monthly_interest_old * deductible_factor_old)
  }

  if (new_balance > 0.005) {
    monthly_interest_new <- new_balance * rate_per_month_new
    deductible_factor_new <- if (new_balance <= mid_limit) 1.0 else (mid_limit / new_balance)
    cumulative_deductible_interest_new <- cumulative_deductible_interest_new +
                                         (monthly_interest_new * deductible_factor_new)
  }

  # Calculate cumulative tax savings differential
  tax_savings_diff <- tax_rate * (cumulative_deductible_interest_new - cumulative_deductible_interest_old)
}
```

### Dynamic Payment Handling
The implementation properly handles scenarios where loan terms differ:

```r
# Dynamic monthly savings calculation
dynamic_monthly_savings[k] <- case_when(
  k <= min(n_payments_remaining, n_payments_new) ~ old_payment - new_payment,  # Both active
  k <= n_payments_remaining && k > n_payments_new ~ old_payment - 0,           # Only old active
  k > n_payments_remaining && k <= n_payments_new ~ 0 - new_payment,           # Only new active
  TRUE ~ 0                                                                      # Both paid off
)
```

### Equity Difference Calculation
```r
# For each month k:
old_balance <- compute_principal_remaining(old_payment, rate_old, max(0, n_payments_remaining - k))
new_balance <- compute_principal_remaining(new_payment, rate_new, max(0, n_payments_new - k))
equity_diff <- old_balance - new_balance  # Additional equity in new scenario
```

The equity difference captures:
- **Lump sum impact**: Immediate equity boost from additional principal payment
- **Amortization differences**: Different paydown rates between old and new loans
- **Term differences**: Impact of refinancing to different loan term

### Key Implementation Advantages
1. **Precision**: Month-by-month calculation avoids approximation errors from analytical formulas
2. **Flexibility**: Handles complex scenarios like different loan terms, variable payments
3. **Robustness**: Graceful handling of edge cases (zero rates, loans paid off early)
4. **Transparency**: Clear separation of cash vs. wealth benefits for different use cases

## 6. Integration Points

### Key Integration Advantages
This design leverages existing app architecture in several important ways:

**Computed Values Reused:**
- **Current Principal Balance**: Calculated from `input$loan_amount`, `monthly_rate_dec()`, `input$mortgage_term`, and `input$loan_start` using existing functions
- **Current Interest Rate**: Direct use of `input$annual_rate_pct` and `monthly_rate_dec()`
- **Remaining Payments**: Computed from loan start date vs. current date
- **Monthly Payment**: Calculated using `compute_monthly_payment()` from existing loan details

**UI Consistency:**
- Uses same `autonumericInput` patterns with currency formatting
- Leverages `shinyhelper` for consistent tooltips
- Follows existing `conditionalPanel` patterns for advanced controls
- Uses same `ggiraph` integration for interactive plots
- Maintains `actionButton` styling and placement patterns

**Server Patterns:**
- Follows `eventReactive()` pattern for calculation triggers
- Uses consistent `validate()` and `req()` patterns
- Leverages existing `monthly_rate_dec()` reactive
- Maintains pattern of showing current state before analysis

### Dependencies
- Leverage `fct_annuity.R` functions for payment calculations
- Use `fct_visualizations.R` patterns for plot styling
- Follow existing validation and error handling patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing reactive patterns

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for mathematical functions in `test-fct_refinance.R`
- Edge case testing (zero rates, negative values, extreme scenarios)
- Integration tests for UI reactive behavior
- Mathematical validation against known scenarios

### Documentation
- Comprehensive roxygen2 documentation
- Working examples in all function docs
- Vignette section on refinance analysis
- Integration with existing pkgdown site

## 7. Implementation Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Functions (COMPLETED)
1. âœ… Implemented `calculate_refinance_benefit_curve()` with full mathematical logic
   - Complete month-by-month benefit calculation including investment returns, tax savings, and equity differences
   - Supports both cash benefit (excluding equity) and wealth benefit (including equity) tracking
   - Handles complex scenarios like loans with different terms and dynamic payment calculations
   - Returns comprehensive data structure with breakeven analysis for both cash and wealth scenarios

2. âœ… Added helper functions for FV calculations and tax differentials
   - `calculate_invested_savings_fv()`: Future value calculations with zero-rate edge case handling
   - `calculate_tax_savings_differential()`: MID-aware tax savings with precise limit calculations

3. âœ… Created comprehensive unit tests (367 lines of test coverage)
   - Mathematical validation against known scenarios
   - Edge case testing (zero rates, rate increases, MID limits, floating point precision)
   - Real-world scenario validation (good vs. marginal refinancing decisions)
   - Comprehensive input validation testing

4. âœ… Documented all functions with examples
   - Complete roxygen2 documentation with parameter descriptions and return value details
   - Working examples for all functions demonstrating typical usage patterns

### âœ… Phase 2: Visualization (COMPLETED)
1. âœ… Implemented `plot_refinance_benefit()` with interactive features (418 lines in fct_visualizations.R)
   - Dual-line visualization: separate cash benefit and wealth benefit curves
   - Dynamic tooltip system that correctly handles varying loan terms and payment schedules
   - Support for both new format (with equity tracking) and legacy format (backward compatibility)

2. âœ… Added breakeven highlighting and hover tooltips
   - Visual highlighting of both cash and wealth breakeven points with color-coded annotations
   - Rich interactive tooltips showing monthly payments, savings, and benefit breakdowns
   - Smart tooltip positioning to avoid overlap with plot elements

3. âœ… Ensured consistent styling with existing plots
   - Integrated with existing ggiraph framework and styling patterns
   - Color-coded line types (solid for wealth, dashed for cash benefits)
   - Professional theme matching other visualizations in the package

4. âœ… Tested across different data scenarios (524 lines of test coverage)
   - Realistic refinancing scenarios with actual calculation function integration
   - Edge cases: no breakeven, immediate breakeven, simultaneous loan payoffs
   - Complex scenarios: new loan paid off first, lump sum paydowns, high-value mortgages
   - Backward compatibility testing with legacy data formats

### Phase 3: UI Integration
1. Add refinance tab to main UI
2. Implement all input controls with validation
3. Create server logic with reactive calculations
4. Add summary table with key metrics

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
1. Integration testing of full workflow
2. Performance optimization for large datasets
3. Enhanced error handling and user feedback
4. Documentation and help system updates

## 8. Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Cache expensive calculations in reactive values
- Limit maximum evaluation periods for responsiveness
- Optimize plot rendering for large datasets

### Robustness
- Handle edge cases (zero rates, extreme values)
- Graceful degradation for calculation failures
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs

### Extensibility
- Design functions to accommodate future enhancements
- Modular architecture for easy testing and maintenance
- Consistent API with existing library functions
