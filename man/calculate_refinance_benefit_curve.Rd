\value{
List containing:
  - months: Vector of evaluation months (1 to max_eval_months)
  - net_benefits: Vector of cumulative net benefits for each month (total wealth impact)
  - net_cash_benefits: Vector of cumulative cash benefits for each month (excluding equity)
  - equity_differences: Vector of equity differences for each month (old_balance - new_balance)
  - breakeven_month: First month where total benefit > 0 (NA if none)
  - cash_breakeven_month: First month where cash benefit > 0 (NA if none)
  - old_payment: Monthly payment on existing loan
  - new_payment: Monthly payment on refinance loan
  - monthly_savings: Difference in monthly payments
}
\description{
Computes the cumulative net benefit of refinancing vs. keeping existing loan
for each month of a specified holding period. Handles both beneficial refinances
(rate reductions) and detrimental refinances (rate increases) by properly
accounting for investment opportunities or additional costs.
