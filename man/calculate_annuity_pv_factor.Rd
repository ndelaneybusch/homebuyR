\title{Calculate Present Value Factor of an Ordinary Annuity}
\usage{
calculate_annuity_pv_factor(rate_per_period, n_periods)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate_per_period}{Numeric. The interest rate per period (e.g., month).
Must be non-negative.}

\item{n_periods}{Integer. The total number of periods (e.g., payments).
Must be positive.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value annuity factor.
}
\description{
Computes the factor used to determine the present value of a series of
equal payments (annuity) made at the end of each period.
Handles the special case where the interest rate is zero.
}
\examples{
# Factor for 360 months at 0.5\% monthly rate
calculate_annuity_pv_factor(0.06 / 12, 360)

# Factor for 12 months at 0\% rate
calculate_annuity_pv_factor(0, 12)
