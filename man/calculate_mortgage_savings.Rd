\arguments{
\item{principal}{Numeric. The original loan amount. Must be positive.}

\item{rate_per_month}{Numeric. The monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12).
Must be non-negative.}

\item{n_payments_total}{Integer. The total number of payments in the original loan term.
Must be positive.}

\item{extra_monthly_payment}{Numeric. Additional amount paid toward principal each month.
Defaults to 0.}

\item{lump_sum_payment}{Numeric. One-time additional payment toward principal.
Defaults to 0.}

\item{payment_number_for_prepay_start}{Integer. The payment number (1-based) when the
lump sum payment is made. Must be between 1 and n_payments_total, or NA if
no lump sum payment is made. Defaults to 1 (first payment).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{total_interest_savings}{Total interest saved over the life of the loan}
  \item{months_saved}{Number of months earlier the loan is paid off}
  \item{new_loan_term_months}{The new loan term in months with extra payments}
  \item{original_total_interest}{Total interest paid in the original loan}
  \item{new_total_interest}{Total interest paid with extra payments}

on a mortgage. Extra payments can be made as a one-time lump sum, additional
monthly payments, or both.

# Example: $300,000 loan at 6\% APR for 30 years
principal <- 300000
annual_rate <- 0.06
monthly_rate <- annual_rate / 12
term_years <- 30

# Should show interest savings and reduced term

# With $10,000 lump sum payment at the start

  rate_per_month = monthly_rate,
  n_payments_total = n_payments,
