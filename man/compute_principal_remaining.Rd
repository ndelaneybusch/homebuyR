\title{Compute Remaining Principal Balance}
\usage{
compute_principal_remaining(
  monthly_payment,
  rate_per_month,
  n_payments_remaining
)
}
\arguments{
\item{monthly_payment}{Numeric. The fixed monthly payment amount.
Must be non-negative.}

\item{rate_per_month}{Numeric. The interest rate per month.
Must be non-negative.}

\item{n_payments_remaining}{Integer. The number of payments still remaining
on the loan. Must be non-negative.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The calculated remaining principal balance.
}
\description{
Calculates the outstanding principal balance of a loan after a certain
number of payments have been made. This is equivalent to the present value
of the remaining future payments.
}
\examples{
# Calculate remaining principal on a $300k, 30yr, 6\% APR loan after 5 years (60 payments made)
annual_rate <- 0.06
monthly_rate <- annual_rate / 12
payment <- compute_monthly_payment(300000, monthly_rate, 360) # approx 1798.65
payments_made <- 60
total_payments <- 360
remaining_payments <- total_payments - payments_made
compute_principal_remaining(monthly_payment = payment,
                            rate_per_month = monthly_rate,
                            n_payments_remaining = remaining_payments)
# Expected output: approx 278719.03

# Remaining principal when 0 payments remain

                            rate_per_month = monthly_rate,
                            n_payments_remaining = 0)
# Expected output: 0

# Remaining principal on a 0\% loan after some payments
compute_principal_remaining(monthly_payment = 1000,
                            rate_per_month = 0,
                            n_payments_remaining = 6) # 6 payments left on a 12k loan
# Expected output: 6000
