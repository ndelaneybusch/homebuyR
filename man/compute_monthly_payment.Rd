\examples{
# Calculate payment for a $300,000 loan over 30 years (360 months) at 6\% APR
annual_rate <- 0.06
monthly_rate <- annual_rate / 12
compute_monthly_payment(
  principal = 300000,
  rate_per_month = monthly_rate,
  n_payments_total = 360
)
# Expected output: approx 1798.65

# Calculate payment for a 0\% interest loan
compute_monthly_payment(
  principal = 12000,
  rate_per_month = 0,
  n_payments_total = 12
)
# Expected output: 1000
