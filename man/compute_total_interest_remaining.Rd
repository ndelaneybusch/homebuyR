\title{Compute Total Interest Remaining}
\usage{
compute_total_interest_remaining(
  monthly_payment,
  rate_per_month,
  n_payments_remaining
)
}
\arguments{
\item{monthly_payment}{Numeric. The fixed monthly payment amount.
Must be non-negative.}

\item{rate_per_month}{Numeric. The interest rate per month.
Must be non-negative.}

\item{n_payments_remaining}{Integer. The number of payments still remaining
on the loan. Must be non-negative.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The total interest yet to be paid.
}
\description{
Calculates the total amount of interest that will be paid over the
remaining life of the loan. This is the sum of all future payments minus
the remaining principal balance.
}
\examples{
# Calculate interest remaining on a $300k, 30yr, 6\% APR loan after 5 years (60 payments made)
annual_rate <- 0.06
monthly_rate <- annual_rate / 12
original_principal <- 300000
total_payments <- 360
payment <- compute_monthly_payment(original_principal, monthly_rate, total_payments) # approx 1798.65
payments_made <- 60
remaining_payments <- total_payments - payments_made

compute_total_interest_remaining(monthly_payment = payment,
                                 rate_per_month = monthly_rate,
                                 n_payments_remaining = remaining_payments)
# Expected output: approx 260876.89
# (Total remaining payments = 1798.65 * 300 = 539595)
# (Remaining principal = 278719.03)
# (Interest remaining = 539595 - 278719.03 = 260875.97 - diff due to rounding in example)

# Interest remaining on a 0\% loan
compute_total_interest_remaining(monthly_payment = 1000,
                                 rate_per_month = 0,
                                 n_payments_remaining = 6)
# Expected output: 0
